# Theme Editor

Customize the color palette for your Pallas UI components. Select different colors for primary, success, warning, error, and info states to see how they affect the appearance of components.

<ThemePreview />

## How it works

The theme editor allows you to experiment with different color combinations without modifying your actual design tokens. This is useful for:

1. Exploring different color schemes for your application
2. Testing accessibility and contrast with various color combinations
3. Previewing how components will look with custom branding colors

When you select a color, the preview section updates in real-time to show how components would appear with your selected theme. This is achieved by dynamically generating CSS variables that override the default styles just for the preview section.
